Around these parts, mid- to late-December is the darkest time of the year, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t beauty to be found in nature. The polar night is the time during winter, near the north (and south) pole, when the sun never rises above the horizon. Polarnattens paradis is a dark winter ale inspired by the starkly beautiful winter of the polar regions of northern Scandinavia. The beer is 7.8% ABV, densely dark and incorporates several flavors associated with winter in the far north of Sweden, such as light smokiness, subtle rye spiciness, black licorice, and, of course, coffee.
