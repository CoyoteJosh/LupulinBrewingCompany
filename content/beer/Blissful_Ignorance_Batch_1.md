Batch #1 starts with a single 2-row pale malt to let the hops shine. We brewed this one with copious amounts of El Dorado & Meridian hops, and then dry-hopped it twice for over 5 lbs per barrel of total hops. This one finishes very dry, letting the hops punch you in the mouth. But, watch out! It's a smooth drinker at 9% ABV and will catch up to you quick! Flavor and aroma notes are of tropical fruits like mango, along with watermelon and stone fruits. There is just enough biscuity malt sweetness to carry the beer, but the hops are the main event on this one.
