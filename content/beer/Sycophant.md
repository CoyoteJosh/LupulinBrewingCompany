Curiously strong, Massively dry-hopped ale. Yes-man, ass kisser, brown noser, toady. All of these words describe a sycophant. This beer defies style descriptions. Bold, rich, strong. Flavors of rich malt entwine with dark brown sugar and a huge dry hop of 4 different hops because we don't follow the pack. We are not sycophants.
