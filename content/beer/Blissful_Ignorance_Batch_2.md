Batch #2 starts out similar to Batch #1 with a clean malt base and a dry, 9% abv to let the hops shine through. That is where the flavor takes a turn. Batch #1 was brewed to showcase two newer hop varieties, whereas Batch #2 is a complete assault on the senses. Made with 7 different varieties of hops, over 6 lbs per barrel added throughout the boil and two big dry hops, this beer is full of complex hop character. From piney and dank, to citrus and tropical fruits, and screaming IBU. Once again, we made the hops the main event. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do! Cheers!
