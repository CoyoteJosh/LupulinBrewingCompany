Whether you are new to craft beer or a certified beer geek, the rich flavors and delicate balance of European malts and hops will leave you feeling like you are sitting in a beer caf√© in Belgium. When sipped from a tulip glass, you will pick up notes of bready malt, spicy yeast, and floral hops. The bitterness is just enough to carry the beer and prepare you for the next sip as you relax and dream of adventures to come.
