Lock us up and throw away the key. Putting this many hops into a beer ought to be criminal. Call it wanton waste, negligence, what have you. We should be ashamed of ourselves. Ten different hops, over 10 lbs per barrel. This beer should be illegal. In fact, don't even buy it, or you will be an accomplice to a criminal act. Just leave the rest for us. We know just how to get rid of the evidence...
