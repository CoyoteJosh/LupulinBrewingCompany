- NE Style Double IPA - Inspired by the wonderful hoppy beers coming out of the Northeast. This Double IPA is loaded with waves of some of the juiciest hops available. Citra, Mosaic, Columbus blend together to make this hop juice. Intentionally left hazy with yeast in suspension to create a soft mouthfeel and enhance the flavor of this wonderfully hoppy beer
