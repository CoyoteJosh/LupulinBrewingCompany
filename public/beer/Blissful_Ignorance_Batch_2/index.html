Batch #2 starts out similar to Batch #1 with a clean malt base and a dry, 9% abv to let the hops shine through. That is where the flavor takes a turn. Batch #1 was brewed to showcase two newer hop varieties, whereas Batch #2 is a complete assault on the senses. Made with 7 different varieties of hops, over 6 lbs per barrel added throughout the boil and two big dry hops, this beer is full of complex hop character.
