Summer is cabin season here in Minnesota, and that means long trips on Friday afternoons sitting in traffic with everyone else headed the same way. We know how frustrating staring at tail lights can be when you just want to get to the lake. Lupulin Brewing is located right on one of these routes(Hwy 10), so we brewed this beer in honor of those people who just want to get away and enjoy summer.
