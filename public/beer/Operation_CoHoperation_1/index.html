Lupulin Brewing and Spilled Grain Brewhouse are excited to announce Operation CoHoperation release #1. With Jake from SGB and Matt and Jeff from LBC having spent many late nights drinking beer and homebrewing together in the BYOB homebrew club, we were excited to work together on a collaboration brew. So, another late night drinking session later, we came up with a beer that defies styles and sensibilities. Loads of malt and loads of hops come together to form a concoction of epic flavor.
