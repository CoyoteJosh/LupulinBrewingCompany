When Fall comes around there is just something wonderful about rich beers with the flavor of the season. Our version of this style blends traditional Octoberfest and English Brown styles, with a touch of fall spices. We hope you enjoy this beer as we do, sitting around the fireplace on a cool Fall evening.
