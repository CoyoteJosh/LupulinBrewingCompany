Give us this day Our Daily Bread and forgive us our, blah, blah, blah, whateverâ€¦ Some have said that beer is liquid bread. We like that, and similar to those who came before us, we wanted to brew something that would provide daily nourishment, but not be so powerful as to prevent us from enjoying that nourishment on multiple occasions daily. Our Daily Bread is a beer inspired by Belgian-Style Table Beer, and with its biscuit-like flavor, just a hint of honey, and subtle noble hop spiciness, we think it makes the perfect liquid substitute for bread on almost any occasion.
