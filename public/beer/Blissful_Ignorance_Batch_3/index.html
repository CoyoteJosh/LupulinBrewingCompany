For this version of Blissful Ignorance we started with a rich, malty base. Then we layer in a whole bunch of our favorite hops - Simcoe, Citra, and Amarillo. If all of those juicy hops weren&rsquo;t enough, we aged this beer on over 80 pounds of apricots for an intense fruity, juicy hop experience.
