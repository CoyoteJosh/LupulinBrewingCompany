Brewed to celebrate Big Lake&rsquo;s Spud Fest festival in June of each year. The beer is a light, summer farmhouse style beer. In addition to the barley, the beer is made with wheat, corn, and over 50 pounds of local Big Lake spuds. We peeled the spuds, diced them up, boiled them and then added them to the mash. The beer is a naturally hazy, crisp refreshing summer beer. It has a light fruity note from the yeast we use, and a very light bitterness for easy drinking in warm weather.
