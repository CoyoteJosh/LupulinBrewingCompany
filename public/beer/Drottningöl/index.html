Drottningöl (pronunciation help: DROAT—NING—ÖL) started as a light, crisp, German ale that was then fermented with several hundred pounds of raspberries and blueberries to create a crisp, slightly tart, and refreshing fruit beer. This beer was inspired by late summer days, spent wandering through the forests of central Sweden, foraging for berries. The name, meaning “Queen’s Beer,” comes from the popular Swedish food item, ‘drottningsylt,’ which is a jam consisting of 50% raspberries and 50% blueberries.
