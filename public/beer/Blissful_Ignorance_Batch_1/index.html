Batch #1 starts with a single 2-row pale malt to let the hops shine. We brewed this one with copious amounts of El Dorado &amp; Meridian hops, and then dry-hopped it twice for over 5 lbs per barrel of total hops. This one finishes very dry, letting the hops punch you in the mouth. But, watch out! It&rsquo;s a smooth drinker at 9% ABV and will catch up to you quick!
